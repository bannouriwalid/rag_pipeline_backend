    "Overview": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium (or germ) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the United States, the majority of TB disease cases in people are caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other mycobacteria (such as Mycobacterium bovis ) can also cause TB disease in people. TB usually affects the lungs. TB can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. TB can also affect multiple parts of the body at the same time. For example, TB can affect both the lungs and lymph nodes. Not everyone infected with TB germs becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: inactive TB (or latent TB infection) and active TB disease. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal.",
    "Types": "Inactive TB, TB germs can live in the body without making you sick. This is called inactive TB, or latent TB infection. People with inactive TB are infected with TB germs, but they do not have active TB disease. They do not feel sick, do not have any symptoms, and cannot spread TB to others. Without treatment, people with inactive TB can develop active TB disease at any time and become sick. Active TB Disease, TB germs become active if the immune system can\u2019t stop them from growing. When TB germs are active (multiplying in your body), this is called active TB disease. People with active TB disease feel sick. They may also be able to spread the germs to people they spend time with every day. Without treatment, active TB disease can be fatal.",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms of active TB disease include: A cough that lasts three weeks or longer, Chest pain, Coughing up blood or sputum (phlegm from deep inside the lungs), Weakness or fatigue, Weight loss, Loss of appetite, Chills, Fever, Night sweats, People with inactive TB do not have symptoms. However, without treatment, they can develop active TB disease and become sick.",
    "Risk factors": "Anyone can get TB, but you might have a higher risk for TB if you: Were born in or frequently travel to countries where TB is common, including some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Live or used to live in large group settings where TB is more common, such as homeless shelters, prisons, or jails, Recently spent time with someone who has active TB disease, Have a weaker immune system because of certain medications or health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and HIV, Work in places where TB is more likely to spread, such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and nursing homes",
    "How it spreads": "TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB germs are put into the air when a person with active TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. These germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. TB germs are more likely to spread in indoor areas or other places with poor air circulation (such as a closed vehicle) than in outdoor areas. People who breathe in the air become infected with TB. People with active TB disease are most likely to spread TB germs to people they spend time with every day.",
    "Prevention": "If you are diagnosed with inactive TB, there are treatments available that can help protect you from getting sick with active TB disease.",
    "Testing": "CDC recommends that people that are at increased risk should be tested for TB. There are two types of tests that can find TB infection: TB blood test, The TB blood test is also called an interferon-gamma release assay or IGRA. The TB blood test measures how your immune system reacts to the germs that cause TB. If you have ever received a vaccine for TB, your health care provider should recommend the TB blood test. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by the TB vaccine (BCG vaccine). TB skin test, For the TB skin test, a health care provider uses a small needle to put some testing material under the skin. You will need to return to your health care provider in two to three days to see if there is a reaction. If your TB blood test or skin test result is positive, You have TB germs in your body. Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease. These tests may include a chest x-ray, and a test of the sputum (phlegm) you cough up.",
    "Treatment": "If you have inactive TB, treating it is the best way to protect you from getting sick with active TB disease. If you have active TB disease, you can be treated with medicine. You will need to take and finish all of your TB medicine as directed by your health care provider. This is to help you feel better and prevent other people from getting sick.",
    "Vaccines": "Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is a vaccine for TB disease. The vaccine is not generally used in the United States. It is given to infants and small children in countries where TB is common. It protects children from getting severe forms of active TB disease, such as TB meningitis. Tell your health care provider if you have received the TB vaccine, especially if you are getting tested for TB infection because it can cause a false positive TB skin test reaction. TB blood tests are the preferred tests for people who have received the BCG TB vaccine.",

  {
    "Signs and symptoms": "Active TB Disease, Symptoms of active TB disease depend on where in the body the TB germs are growing. TB germs usually grow in the lungs (pulmonary TB). A bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer, Pain in the chest, Coughing up blood or sputum (phlegm) from deep inside the lungs, Weakness or fatigue,, Weight loss,, No appetite,, Chills,, Fever, and, Sweating at night. TB disease of the lymph nodes may cause a firm red or purple swelling under the skin. TB disease of the kidney may cause blood in the urine. TB meningitis (TB disease of the brain) may cause headache or confusion. TB disease of the spine may cause back pain. TB disease of the larynx may cause hoarseness. Do you have symptoms of active TB disease?, Contact your health care provider or local health department and ask about TB testing. Inactive TB, People with inactive TB do not have symptoms of TB disease. However, without treatment, they can develop active TB disease and become sick.",

    "Causes": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium (or germ) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. When a person breathes in TB germs, the germs can settle in the lungs and begin to grow. From there, they can move through the blood to other parts of the body, such as the kidney, spine, and brain. TB bacteria can live in the body without making you sick. This is called inactive TB, or latent TB infection. People with inactive TB are infected with TB germs, but they do not have active TB disease. They do not feel sick, do not have symptoms of TB disease, and cannot spread TB germs to others. Without treatment, people with inactive TB can develop active TB disease at any time and become sick. TB germs become active if the immune system can't stop them from multiplying and growing in the body. When TB germs are active (multiplying in your body), this is called active TB disease.

The vaccine is not generally used in the United States, Many people born outside the United States have been vaccinated with BCG. It is given to infants and small children in countries where TB is common. It protects children from getting severe forms of active TB disease, such as TB meningitis. The vaccine's protection weakens over time. Tell your health care provider if you have received the TB vaccine, especially if you are getting tested for TB infection.

    "Why get tested": "Getting tested and treated for TB can protect yourself, your family and friends, and your community. You may need a TB test if you have: Symptoms of TB disease, Spent time with someone who has active TB disease, Factors that put you at higher risk of developing active TB disease, Employment, school, travel, or immigration health screening requirements, You may need a TB test even if you do not feel sick. TB germs can live in your body for years without making you feel sick. This is called inactive TB. People with inactive TB do not feel sick and cannot spread TB germs to others.",
    "Who should be tested": "If you are at higher risk of being infected with TB germs, you should get tested. You have a higher risk of being exposed to TB germs if you: Were born in or frequently travel to countries where TB is common, including some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Live or used to live in large group settings where TB is more common, such as homeless shelters, prisons, or jails, Recently spent time with someone who has active TB disease, Work in places where TB is more likely to spread, such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and nursing homes, Some people who have inactive TB never develop TB disease, and others with inactive TB develop active TB disease months or even years later when their immune system can no longer keep the TB germs from multiplying and growing in the body. Anyone can get TB, but some people who have inactive TB are more likely to develop TB disease than others. You have a higher risk of developing TB disease once infected if you: Have a weaker immune system because of certain medications or health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or HIV, Became infected with TB germs in the last two years, Are a baby or young child, especially under five years of age, Inject illegal drugs, Are sick with other diseases that weaken the immune system, Are elderly, Were not treated correctly for TB in the past, TB tests are generally not needed for people with a low risk of infection with TB germs.",
    "Types of tests": "There are two types of tests for TB infection: the TB blood test and the TB skin test. Ask your health care provider which TB test is best for you. TB blood test, TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) use a blood sample to find out if you are infected with TB germs. The tests measure how your immune system reacts when a small amount of your blood is mixed with TB proteins. Tell your health care provider if you received a TB vaccine\u200e\u200e, Many people born outside the United States have received the TB vaccine (also known as Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin or BCG ). TB blood tests are the preferred test for people who have received the TB vaccine. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by BCG vaccination. TB skin test, For the TB skin test, a health care provider uses a small needle to put some testing material under the skin. You will need to return to your health care provider in two to three days to see if there is a reaction. Other tests may be needed, Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease if you have a: Positive TB blood test or TB skin test result, Negative TB blood test or TB skin test result, but you have symptoms of active TB disease, These tests may include a chest x-ray, and a test of the sputum (phlegm) you cough up.",
    "What to do if you've tested positive": "If your TB blood test or TB skin test is positive, you have TB germs in your body. Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease. Keep a record of your positive test result\u200e, Once you have a positive TB blood test or TB skin test result, you may still have a positive test result on future TB tests. This includes even after you finish taking all of your TB medicine for inactive TB or active TB disease. Ask your health care provider for a written record of your positive TB test result. This will be helpful if you are asked to have another TB test in the future.",

    "Contact your health care provider if you have been exposed to TB": "You may have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB) germs if you spent time near someone with active TB disease. TB germs can get into the air when a person with active TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. These germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. TB germs are more likely to spread in indoor areas or other places with poor air circulation (such as a closed vehicle) than in outdoor areas. TB germs are not spread by: Shaking someone's hand, Sharing food or drink, Touching bed linens or toilet seats, Sharing toothbrushes, Kissing, If you think you have been exposed to someone with active TB disease, you should contact your health care provider or local or state health department about getting a TB blood test or TB skin test. Be sure to tell the health care provider when you spent time with the person who has active TB disease. If you work in a health care setting, follow the procedure in your facility's infection control plan.",
    "Only persons with active TB disease can spread TB to others": "It is important to know that a person who is exposed to TB germs is not able to spread the germs to other people right away. Only persons with active TB disease can spread TB germs to others. Before you would be able to spread TB to others, you would have to breathe in TB germs and become infected. TB germs can live in the body without making you sick. This is called inactive TB or latent TB infection. If you are infected with TB germs, and if your body cannot stop TB germs from growing, you develop active TB disease. Some people who have inactive TB never develop TB disease. Other people with inactive TB develop active TB disease months or even years later when their immune system can no longer keep the TB germs from multiplying and growing in the body. People with active TB disease feel sick. Symptoms of active TB disease depend on where the TB germs are growing in the body. Common symptoms of active TB disease include cough, pain in the chest, and coughing up blood or sputum (phlegm). If you have active TB disease of the lungs or throat, you may need to take steps to prevent the spread of TB germs. This may include taking medicine to treat TB and wearing a mask or staying home from work or school for a period of time. People with active TB disease are most likely to spread it to people they spend time with every day. This includes family members, friends, and coworkers or schoolmates.",
    "Contact investigations can help limit the spread of TB": "If you have active TB disease, your health care worker may ask about your contacts (the people you spent time when you were able to spread TB germs). Your health care worker may conduct a contact investigation, also known as contact tracing. Contact tracing is the process of identifying people who have recently been in contact with someone diagnosed with an infectious disease. Contact tracing is the process of quickly identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent additional transmission. Once a person tests positive for a disease, they will be asked to list the people they have been in contact with and the places they visited during the period in which they were contagious. The patient's contacts will be contacted by the health department or by contact tracers who will explain what precautions they need to take. Contacts may include: People in your household,, Family members,, Friends,, Coworkers,, Classmates,, Neighbors,, People you socialize with, People you spend time with at places of worship (church, synagogue or mosque), and, Anyone else who spent time with you while you were able to spread TB germs. You can help your family and friends stay healthy by sharing the names of people you have spent time with while you were sick with TB disease. Your health care worker will decide which of your contacts they need to speak with based on the information you provide. Your health care worker will let your contacts know that they have been exposed to TB and might need to be tested for TB. The information you share with the health care worker is kept confidential. Your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider. Your information will be collected for health purposes only and will not be shared with any other agencies, like law enforcement or immigration. It is important to quickly identify your TB contacts so they can be tested for TB and start treatment if needed. You can help stop the spread of TB. By participating in a contact investigation, you are helping to protect people who may have been exposed to TB, prevent future TB outbreaks, and keep your community safe from TB. A health care worker will ask you questions during a contact investigation, A health care worker may ask the following questions during a contact investigation to learn more about you and identify your contacts: What symptoms do you have?, How long have you been coughing?, When did you first start feeling sick?, Where do you live?, Where do you go to school, work, or church?, Where do you socialize with others?, Where did you spend time when you were feeling sick?, Who lives with you?, Who are the people you've spent time with at home, work, school, church, social activities, etc. while you were feeling sick?, Who do you see every day?, What's your daily routine?, How do you get to work, school, church, or other places?, What do you do in your free time?",

    "Conditions that can increase risk": "Some people with weakened immune systems (due to certain medications or health conditions) are at very high risk of developing active TB disease once infected with TB germs. It is very important that these people receive treatment for inactive TB to prevent the development of active TB disease. Some medications or health conditions can weaken your immune system. These include: HIV infection, Substance use (such as injection drug use), Specialized treatment for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease, Organ transplants, Severe kidney disease, Head and neck cancer, Diabetes, Medical treatments such as corticosteroids, Silicosis, Low body weight, Babies and young children often have weak immune systems. Children, especially those under age five, have a higher risk of developing TB disease once infected with TB germs.",
    "Places with increased risk": "You have a higher risk of being exposed to TB germs if you: Were born in or frequently travel to countries where TB is common, including some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Live or used to live in large group settings where TB is more common, such as homeless shelters, prisons, or jails, Work in places where TB is more likely to spread, such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and nursing homes",

Some people with weakened immune systems (due to certain medications or health conditions ) are at very high risk of developing active TB disease once infected with TB germs. It is very important that they receive treatment for inactive TB to prevent the development of active TB disease. If you have active TB disease of the lungs or throat, you may need to take steps to prevent spreading TB germs to other people. If you have TB disease of the lungs or throat, you could be infectious. This means you could spread TB germs to others. You and your health care provider will discuss how to prevent the spread of TB germs to other people. The most important way you can prevent the spread of TB is to take all medicines exactly as directed by your health care provider. Keep all your clinic appointments. Your health care provider needs to see how you are doing. This often requires another chest x-ray or a test of the sputum (or phlegm) you may cough up. These tests will show: If the TB medicines are working, If you can still spread TB germs to others, Be sure to tell your health care provider about anything you think is wrong. Take all TB medicines exactly as prescribed by your health care provider. Do not miss any doses and do not stop treatment early. It can be very dangerous to stop taking your medicines or not to take all your medicines regularly. Tell your health care provider if you are having trouble taking the medicines. If you are sick enough with TB disease to go to a hospital, you may stay in a special room. These rooms use air vents that keep TB germs from spreading to other rooms. People who work in these special rooms must wear a special face mask to protect themselves from TB germs. You must stay in the room so that you will not spread TB germs to other people. Take your medicines as directed. This is very important!, Always cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or laugh. Put the tissue in a closed bag and throw it away. Do not go to work or school until your health care provider tells you it is safe. Separate yourself from others and avoid close contact with anyone. Sleep in a bedroom away from other family members. Separate yourself from others and avoid close contact with anyone. Sleep in a bedroom away from other family members. Air out your room often to the outside of the building (if it is not too cold outside). TB germs spread in small, closed spaces where air does not move. Put a fan in your window to blow air to the outside. If you open other windows in the room, the fan also will pull in fresh air. This will reduce the chances that TB germs will stay in the room and infect someone who breathes the air. TB germs spread in small, closed spaces where air does not move.

This will reduce the chances that TB germs will stay in the room and infect someone who breathes the air. Your health care provider will tell you when you can return to work or school or visit with friends. Health care settings should have infection control plans to minimize the risk for exposure to and spread of TB. Health care settings, especially those where people have a higher risk for exposure to TB, should have a TB infection control plan. These plans should describe policies and procedures for TB prevention, including: Administrative measures, such as facility risk assessments, health care personnel screening, and education. Environmental controls, Respiratory protective equipment",

    "Overview": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that most often affects the lungs. It spreads through the air when people with TB cough, sneeze or spit. Tuberculosis is preventable and curable. About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria. About 5\u201310% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease. Those who are infected but free of disease cannot transmit it. TB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment. In certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB. The vaccine prevents deaths from TB and protects children from serious forms of TB. Certain conditions can increase a person\u2019s risk for TB disease: diabetes (high blood sugar), weakened immune system (for example, from HIV or AIDS), being malnourished, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol,",
    "Symptoms": "People with TB infection don\u2019t feel sick and aren\u2019t contagious. Only a small proportion of people who get infected with TB will get TB disease and symptoms. Babies and children are at higher risk. TB disease occurs when bacteria multiply in the body and affect different organs. TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it. Some people with TB disease do not have any symptoms. Common symptoms of TB are: prolonged cough (sometimes with blood), chest pain, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, The symptoms people get depend on which part of the body is affected by TB. While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also involve the kidneys, brain, spine and skin.",
    "Prevention": "Follow these steps to help prevent tuberculosis infection and spread: Seek medical attention if you have symptoms like prolonged cough, fever and unexplained weight loss as early treatment for TB can help stop the spread of disease and improve your chances of recovery, Get tested for TB if you are at increased risk, such as if you have HIV or are in contact with people who have TB in your household or workplace, TB preventive treatment (or TPT) prevents infection from becoming disease. If prescribed TPT, complete the full course, If you have TB, practice good hygiene when coughing, including avoiding contact with other people and wearing a mask, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of sputum and used tissues properly, Special measures like respirators and ventilation are important to reduce infection in healthcare facilities and other institutions,",
    "Diagnosis": "WHO recommends the use of rapid molecular diagnostic tests as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB. Rapid diagnostic tests recommended by WHO include the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Truenat assays. These tests have high diagnostic accuracy and will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB. A tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or newer antigen-based skin tests (TBST) can be used to identity people with infection. Diagnosing multidrug-resistant and other resistant forms of TB (see multidrug-resistant TB section below) as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive. Tuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children.",
    "Treatment": "Tuberculosis disease is treated with special antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease. The most common antibiotics used are: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, To be effective, medications need to be taken daily for 4\u20136 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice as it can prompt TB bacteria in the body to become resistant to the drugs. TB that doesn\u2019t respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires treatment with different medicines.",
    "Impact": "TB mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2023, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in the WHO South-East Asia Region (45%), followed by the African Region (24%) and the Western Pacific Region (17%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with more than two-thirds of the global total in Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines. Globally, about 50% of people treated for TB and their households face total costs (direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses) that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income), far from the WHO End TB Strategy target of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2023, there were estimated 0.96million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.75 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70 million to smoking, 0.61 million to HIV infection, and 0.38 million to diabetes.",
