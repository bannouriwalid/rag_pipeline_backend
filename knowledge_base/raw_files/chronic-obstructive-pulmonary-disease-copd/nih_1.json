  "Symptoms": "At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more serious. There may be times when symptoms suddenly worsen — known as a flare-up or an exacerbation — because of triggers such as an infection or something in the environment like dust or smoke.",
  "COPD symptoms": "Recognize the Signs of COPD Earlier diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in quality of life for people who have COPD. Common symptoms of COPD include: Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. You may feel like breathing takes more effort or that you are gasping for air. An ongoing cough or a cough that produces a lot of mucus, sometimes called a smoker’s cough. This is often the first symptom of COPD. Wheezing or a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe. Chest tightness or heaviness, which may make it hard to take a deep breath or make it painful to breathe. Fatigue or extreme tiredness. Not everyone who has these symptoms has COPD. Likewise, not everyone with COPD has all these symptoms. Your healthcare provider can determine whether you have COPD. You may also have additional conditions that need to be diagnosed and treated. It is very common for people with COPD to have other conditions, including heart disease. If your symptoms are mild, you may adjust your lifestyle to make breathing easier. For example, you may take the elevator instead of the stairs. For more serious symptoms, such as becoming short of breath during physical work, your healthcare provider can provide treatments and other ways to help. Severe COPD can cause additional symptoms, such as lack of appetite, loss of weight and muscle, anxiety, and depression. Learn more about living with COPD .

  "COPD flare-ups": "Certain triggers, such as smells, cold air, poor air quality, colds, the flu, or a lung infection, can lead to a sudden worsening of symptoms. When this happens, it is called a flare-up or an exacerbation . With a flare-up, you have a harder time breathing. You may also have chest tightness or a fever. You may need to cough or clear your throat more. Or you might find yourself coughing up yellow or green phlegm. Call your healthcare provider right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. Your provider may prescribe antibiotics to treat an infection. They may also give you other medicines, such as bronchodilators and inhaled or oral steroids, to help you breathe. Serious symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. How serious a flare-up is depends on the amount of lung damage you have. Poor sleep can also increase the risk of a flare-up. Take steps to keep yourself healthy to help prevent a flare-up.",
  "When to call your healthcare provider": "As soon as you notice symptoms of COPD in yourself or a loved one, make an appointment to see a provider. Don’t wait for your symptoms to become serious. A flare-up may require treatment in a hospital. You — or, if you are unable, your family members or friends — should call 9-1-1 if you are experiencing unusual events: You are having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails have turned blue or gray, a sign of a low oxygen level in your blood. People around you notice that you are not mentally alert. Your heartbeat is very fast. The recommended treatment for your symptoms is not working."
