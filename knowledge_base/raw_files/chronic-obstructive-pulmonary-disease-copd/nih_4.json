  "Prevent COPD before it starts": "The best way to prevent COPD is to quit smoking or, if you don’t smoke, not to start. Also try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dust, and secondhand smoke. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. If you smoke, talk with your provider about programs and products that can help you quit.",
