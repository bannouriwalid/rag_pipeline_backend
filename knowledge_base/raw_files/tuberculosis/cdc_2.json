  "Causes": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium (or germ) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. When a person breathes in TB germs, the germs can settle in the lungs and begin to grow. From there, they can move through the blood to other parts of the body, such as the kidney, spine, and brain. TB bacteria can live in the body without making you sick. This is called inactive TB, or latent TB infection. People with inactive TB are infected with TB germs, but they do not have active TB disease. They do not feel sick, do not have symptoms of TB disease, and cannot spread TB germs to others. Without treatment, people with inactive TB can develop active TB disease at any time and become sick. TB germs become active if the immune system can't stop them from multiplying and growing in the body. When TB germs are active (multiplying in your body), this is called active TB disease. People with active TB disease feel sick. They may also be able to spread the germs to people they spend time with every day. Without treatment, active TB disease can be fatal.",
  "How it spreads": "TB germs can get into the air when a person with active TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. These germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. TB germs are more likely to spread in indoor areas or other places with poor air circulation (such as a closed vehicle) than in outdoor areas. People nearby may breathe in these germs and become infected. TB germs are not spread by: Shaking someone's hand, Sharing food or drink, Touching bed linens or toilet seats, Sharing toothbrushes, Kissing",
