  "Overview": "Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. The vaccine is not generally used in the United States, Many people born outside the United States have been vaccinated with BCG. It is given to infants and small children in countries where TB is common. It protects children from getting severe forms of active TB disease, such as TB meningitis. The vaccine's protection weakens over time. Tell your health care provider if you have received the TB vaccine, especially if you are getting tested for TB infection. The vaccine can cause a false positive TB skin test reaction. TB blood tests are the preferred tests for people who have received the BCG TB vaccine. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by BCG TB vaccination.",
