Common side effects from inhaled corticosteroids include a hoarse voice or a mouth infection called thrush. Biologi medicines, such as benralizumab, may help with asthma that is difficult to control.

Inhaled mast cell stabilizers, such as cromolyn, help prevent swelling in your airways when you are around allergens or other asthma triggers. Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, such as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), may be added to your inhaler to prevent your airways from narrowing. Allergy shots, called subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), turn down the bodyâ€™s response to allergens.

  "Treating specific asthma types": "Some people only have asthma symptoms in certain situations or around specific triggers. Your healthcare provider may give you special instructions to help with your asthma in those cases. Exercise-induced asthma In exercise-induced asthma, your symptoms start or get worse when you do physical activity. Your provider may recommend taking a reliever medicine before exercising to prevent symptoms short term. If you are taking inhaled corticosteroids to control your asthma, you may have fewer symptoms when you exercise. Training regularly and warming up before you exercise can also help prevent symptoms. Talk to your provider if your asthma symptoms make it difficult to stay physically active. It may be a sign that your asthma is not well controlled or is getting worse. Occupational asthma Occupational asthma is asthma that develops or gets worse in the workplace. It can happen in an adult who is around allergens, for example, dust and mold, or other sensitizing agents at work. Once you become sensitized to a substance, being around a very small amount can be enough to trigger serious symptoms. Your asthma can continue to get worse every time you are around the trigger. To prevent asthma flare-ups, you should remove the sensitizing agent from your place of work and avoid any further contact. Allergic asthma Allergic asthma often starts at a young age. Breathing can become difficult when you are around certain allergens, such as pollens, dust mites, or mold. Avoiding the allergens that trigger your asthma can help control your symptoms and prevent flare-ups. Typical treatment includes inhaled corticosteroids. Your healthcare provider may also recommend adding biologic medicines or allergy shots, which can be specific to the allergen. Some people only have seasonal allergic asthma, which means that they do not have symptoms outside of a certain pollen season. Your provider may recommend medicines, such as a daily controller or a reliever inhaler, from the start of your allergy season until a few weeks after the season ends. Nocturnal asthma Nocturnal asthma refers to asthma symptoms that occur at night. It is not a separate type of asthma, but a sign of poor symptom control. It is common for asthma symptoms to get worse at night or in the early morning. Sometimes, your symptoms may wake you up at night. If this happens often, it may be a sign that your asthma is not well controlled. Being around allergens while you sleep may also worsen your symptoms at night. Knowing your asthma triggers and avoiding them at night can help you manage your asthma and sleep better. Participate in a study We lead or sponsor many trials and studies on asthma.
