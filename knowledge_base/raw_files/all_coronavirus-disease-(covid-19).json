    "Learn about COVID-19 and how it spreads": "About COVID-19, COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, the flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than your lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be affected by the disease. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill. Some people, including those with minor or no symptoms, will develop Post-COVID Conditions \u2013 also called Long COVID., How COVID-19 spreads, COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. Other people can breathe in these droplets and particles, or these droplets and particles can land on others' eyes, nose, or mouth. In some circumstances, these droplets may contaminate the surfaces they touch. Anyone infected with COVID-19 can spread it, even if they do NOT have symptoms. COVID-19 can even spread from people to animals in some situations. Risk factors for severe iIlness from COVID-19, Some people are more likely than others to get very sick if they get COVID-19. This includes people who: are older, are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system), have certain disabilities or, have underlying health conditions, Understanding your COVID-19 risk and the risks that might affect others can help you make decisions to protect yourself and others. About variants, Viruses are constantly changing, including the virus that causes COVID-19. These changes occur over time and can lead to the emergence of variants that may have new characteristics, including different ways of spreading. Slowing the spread of the virus, by protecting yourself and others, can help slow new variants from developing. Prevention, There are many actions you can take to help protect you, your household, and your community from COVID-19. CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance provides actions you can take to lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission (catching and spreading COVID-19) and lower the risk of severe illness if you get sick.",

    "Signs and symptoms": "The following list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. Possible symptoms include: Fever or chills, Cough, Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, Sore throat, Congestion or runny nose, New loss of taste or smell, Fatigue, Muscle or body aches, Headache, Nausea or vomiting, Diarrhea, CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Feeling Sick?, Stay home and away from others (including people you live with who are not sick) if you have symptoms that aren't better explained by another cause. Seek health care promptly for testing and/or treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness ; treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness.",
    "When to seek emergency help": "Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID 19: Trouble breathing, Persistent pain or pressure in the chest, New confusion, Inability to wake or stay awake, Depending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue. If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. *This list does not include all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.",
    "Difference between flu and COVID-19": "Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, and flu is caused by infection with one of the influenza viruses. You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same. Some nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), including PCR tests, can differentiate between flu and COVID-19 at the same time. If one of these tests is not available, many testing locations provide flu and COVID-19 tests separately.",

    "Overview": "This information is for a general audience. Healthcare professionals should see Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19 for more detailed information. Stay Up to Date With COVID-19 Vaccines, Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and following preventive measures are especially important if you are older or have one or more health conditions, including those listed below. If you have one or more of the conditions listed below, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 and be hospitalized, need intensive care, require a ventilator to breathe, and/or die. Risk factors for getting very sick with COVID-19, Older adults are at highest risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. More than 81% of COVID-19 deaths occur in people over age 65. The number of deaths among people over age 65 is 97 times higher than among people ages 18-29 years. Your risk of severe illness from COVID-19 increases as the number of your underlying medical conditions increases. Some people are at increased risk of getting very sick or dying from COVID-19 because of where they live or work, or because they can\u2019t get health care. This includes many people from racial and ethnic minority groups and people with disabilities. Specific information on children and teens, People of all ages, including children and teens, can get very sick from COVID-19, especially those with underlying medical conditions. This includes children and teens with: Medical complexity, Genetic, neurologic, or metabolic conditions, Congenital heart disease, Like adults, children and teens with obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or who are immunocompromised can also be at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. Check out Stay Up to Date on COVID-19 Vaccines for more information on vaccinating your child. Learn how CDC develops COVID-19 vaccination recommendations. Contact Your Healthcare Provider, If you have questions about a condition not included on this list or questions on how to manage your condition and protect yourself from COVID-19 and severe illness. For treatment options. You must start treatment within 5-7 days from the time your symptoms start. Treatment can reduce your risk of hospitalization by more than 50% and reduce your risk of death. You can also visit a Test to Treat location.",
    "Conditions that can increase risk": "The conditions on this list are in alphabetical order. They are not in order of risk. CDC reviewed each medical condition on this list to ensure they met criteria for inclusion. If there is new evidence, other conditions might be added to the list. This list does not include all medical conditions that place a person at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Rare medical conditions, including many conditions that mostly affect children, may not be included. A person with a condition that is not listed may still be at greater risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 than other people. It is important to talk with your healthcare provider about your risk.

    "Types of tests": "Viral tests look for a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by testing specimens from your nose or mouth. There are two main types of viral tests. Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs), Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), including PCR tests, are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. NAATs tests are the gold standard for COVID-19 tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing and may take up to 3 days to receive results. Some NAATs may be performed at the point-of-care and provide results more quickly. Antigen Tests, Antigen tests* are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than NAAT tests, especially when symptoms are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single NAAT test can be used to confirm an antigen test result. *Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test. When you get tested, Choose the right type of test for your circumstance. When using an antigen test, follow the recommendations provided by FDA and the test's manufacturer. If you do not, your results may be less likely to correctly indicate whether you have COVID-19 or not.",
    "Choosing a COVID-19 test": "I want to get tested and: You may choose a NAAT, including PCR, or antigen test. If you use an antigen test and your result is negative, repeat testing following FDA recommendations. I have symptoms: Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following FDA recommendations. I do not have symptoms: Testing is not recommended to detect a new infection. I have symptoms: Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following FDA recommendations. I do not have symptoms: Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following FDA recommendations. After a positive test result, you may continue to test positive for some time. Some tests, especially NAAT tests, may continue to show a positive result for up to 90 days. Reinfections can occur within 90 days, which can make it hard to know if a positive test indicates a new infection. Consider consulting a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your circumstances.",
    "Interpreting your results": "If your COVID-19 test is positive, A positive COVID-19 test means the virus was detected and you have or recently had an infection. Take steps to prevent spreading COVID-19. Monitor your symptoms. If you have any emergency warning signs, seek emergency care immediately. Seek health care right away for treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness. Treatment may be an option to make your symptoms less severe and shorten the time you are sick. Treatment needs to be started within a few days of when your symptoms begin. If your COVID-19 test is negative, A negative COVID-19 test means the test did not detect the virus, but this doesn't rule out that you could have an infection. If you used an antigen test, follow FDA recommendations for repeat testing. If you have symptoms: You may have COVID-19 but tested before the virus was detectable. You may have another viral infection or illness. Take actions to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory viruses. Contact a healthcare provider if you have any questions about your test result. You may have COVID-19 but tested before the virus was detectable. You may have another viral infection or illness. Take actions to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory viruses. Contact a healthcare provider if you have any questions about your test result.",

    "COVID-19 Treatment Options": "Testing for COVID-19, Testing for COVID-19\u202fcan help you decide what to do next, like getting treatment to reduce your risk of severe illness and taking steps to lower your chances of spreading the virus to others. If you think you could have COVID-19 and are at higher risk for severe illness, talk to your healthcare provider about testing and/or treatment right away, even if your symptoms are mild. If you don't have a healthcare provider, contact your local pharmacy, community health center, or health department. Don't Delay, Treatment must be started within 5-7 days of when your symptoms first start. You do not need a positive test to start treatment so if you get sick and are at high risk for severe illness, talk to your healthcare provider as soon as possible. People who are more likely to get very sick include: Older adults (especially those ages 65 years or older, with risk increasing with advancing age), People who are unvaccinated or are not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations, People with certain medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease, heart disease, or a weakened immune system. Treatments, FDA has authorized or approved several antiviral medications used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in people who are more likely to get very sick. Antiviral medications target specific parts of the virus to stop it from multiplying in the body once someone is infected, helping to prevent severe illness and death. The Infectious Diseases Society of America provides Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 for healthcare providers to help them work with their patients and determine the best treatment options for their patients. Several treatment options are available for treating COVID-19. They include: Some treatments might have side effects or interact with other medications you are taking. Side effects vary for each medication. For example, Paxlovid can cause a metallic taste in your mouth which goes away when you stop taking the medication. Paxlovid is more likely to interact with other medications than other COVID-19 antivirals, but most people can still take it. Check for possible interactions with your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are taking other medications to make sure that COVID-19 treatments can be safely taken at the same time. If you are hospitalized, your healthcare provider might use other types of medications, depending on how sick you are. These could include medications to treat the virus, reduce an overactive immune response, or treat COVID-19 complications. If you have a weakened immune system, have received antiviral treatment, and continue to experience COVID-19 symptoms, your healthcare provider may recommend additional treatment, including convalescent plasma. Accessing Treatment, Visit Treatment Locator (hhs.gov) or call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) to find a location that offers testing and treatment or a pharmacy where you can fill your prescription. Did you know?, COVID-19 oral antiviral treatments Paxlovid and Lagevrio are available for certain people at a lower cost. Patient assistance programs are available to people who are underinsured, uninsured, who are on Medicaid, and certain people on Medicare to lower their out-of-pocket costs. You should enroll in these programs to learn if you can receive assistance for specific medications, regardless of your insurance status. Call ahead to your healthcare provider and insurer to confirm coverage eligibility. People have been seriously harmed (and have even died) after taking products not approved for use to treat or prevent COVID-19, even if they were approved or prescribed for other uses. Talk to a healthcare provider about taking medications to treat COVID-19.",
    "Preventing COVID-19": "COVID-19 Vaccines, A COVID-19 vaccine is the first step to prevent severe health outcomes. Antiviral treatments are not a replacement for COVID-19 vaccinations. COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States effectively protect people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and even dying. As with vaccines for other diseases, you are protected best when you stay up to date. Where to find free COVID-19 vaccines this season, Free COVID-19 vaccines may be available through private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, public health safety net programs, and CDC's Vaccines for Children Program. People with weakened immune systems, who are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and might have decreased response to vaccination, may require additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Alongside vaccination, practicing core prevention strategies like good hygiene, taking steps for cleaner air, and staying home when sick is vital in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (Medication for Preventing COVID-19), FDA has authorized a preventive monoclonal antibody for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, ages 12 years and older, and weigh at least 88 pounds. In addition to vaccination, Pemivibart (Pemgarda\u2122) may provide another layer of protection against COVID-19 and can be given at least 2 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. A healthcare provider gives Pemgarda as a single intravenous infusion over 60 minutes at a doctor's office or healthcare facility. If continued protection is needed, additional doses should be administered every 3 months. People who are privately insured or have Medicare part B may receive Pemgarda for free. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if Pemgarda is right for you. CDC is monitoring variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 and how commonly they occur to understand if they might affect how well Pemgarda works. The FDA will provide additional updates to the Emergency Use Authorization materials, as appropriate, if new information emerges. This is the only preventive option available for COVID-19 for the immunocompromised community, as described above, at the present time.",

  {
    "Core Prevention Strategies": "CDC recommends that all people use core prevention strategies to protect themselves and others from COVID-19: Stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines. Although vaccinated people sometimes get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccines significantly lowers the risk of getting very sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19. Although vaccinated people sometimes get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccines significantly lowers the risk of getting very sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19. Practice good hygiene (practices that improve cleanliness), Take steps for cleaner air, When you are sick: Use precautions to prevent spread, including staying home and away from others (including people you live with who are not sick) if you have respiratory symptoms. Learn when you can go back to your normal activities. Learn when you can go back to your normal activities. Seek health care promptly for testing and/or treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness. Treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness, but it needs to be started within a few days of when your symptoms begin. Additional Prevention Strategies, In addition, there are other prevention strategies that you can choose to further protect yourself and others. Wearing a mask and putting distance between yourself and others can help lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Testing for COVID-19 can help you decide what to do next, like getting treatment to reduce your risk of severe illness and taking steps to lower your chances of spreading COVID-19 to others.",
    "What to watch out for": "Using these prevention strategies can be especially helpful when: Respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, are causing a lot of illness in your community, You or those around you have risk factors for severe illness, You or those around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering, Check Your Community, Find out if respiratory viruses are causing a lot of illness in your community. Data updated weekly.",

    "Overview": "COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It usually spreads between people in close contact. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death. Although a person can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, they are more likely to have mild or no symptoms. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die, but most people will recover without treatment. People over age 60 and those with existing medical conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill. These conditions include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression including HIV, cancer and pregnancy. Unvaccinated people also have a higher risk of severe symptoms.",
    "Symptoms": "People may experience different symptoms from COVID-19. Symptoms usually begin 5\u20136 days after exposure and last 1\u201314 days. The most common symptoms are: fever, chills, sore throat, Less common symptoms are: muscle aches and heavyarms or legs, severe fatigue ortiredness, runny or blocked nose,or sneezing, headache, sore eyes, dizziness, new and persistentcough, tight chest or chestpain, shortness of breath, hoarse voice, numbness or tingling, appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea, loss or change of senseof taste or smell, difficulty sleeping, People with the following symptoms should seek immediate medical attention: difficulty breathing,especially at rest, or unable to speak in sentences, confusion, drowsiness or loss ofconsciousness, persistent pain orpressure in the chest, skin being cold orclammy, or turning pale or a bluish colour, loss of speech or movement, People who have pre-existing health problems are at higher risk when they have COVID-19; they should seek medical help early if worried about their condition. These include people taking immunosuppressive medication; those with chronic heart, lung, liver or rheumatological problems; those with HIV, diabetes, cancer. obesity or dementia. People with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment should receive treatment as soon as possible. The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection. Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms. These long-term effects are called long COVID (or post COVID-19 condition). The most common symptoms associated with long COVID include fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction (for example, confusion, forgetfulness, or a lack of mental focus or clarity). Long COVID can affect a person\u2019s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores.",
    "Treatment": "Most people will recover without needing treatment in a hospital. For those who need it, doctors will suggest treatments for COVID-19 based on the severity of the disease and the risk of it getting worse. They will consider the person\u2019s age and if they have other health problems. More on treatment",
    "Prevention": "People should get vaccinated as soon as it\u2019s their turn. They should follow local guidance on vaccination and ways to protect themselves against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. To prevent the spread of COVID-19: avoid crowds and keep asafe distance from others, even if they don\u2019t appear to be sick;, wear a properly fittedmask if you feel sick, have been close to people who are sick, if you areat high-risk, or in crowded or poorly ventilated areas;, clean your handsfrequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water;, cover your mouth andnose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze;, dispose of used tissuesright away and clean your hands; and, if you develop symptomsor test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover, Vaccination against COVID-19 is based on priority groups such as people aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic health problems, immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, pregnant persons, and unvaccinated people. In March 2023, WHO updated its recommendations on primary series vaccination (two doses of any vaccine) as well as the need for booster doses. These recommendations are time-limited and can change at any time depending on how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is circulating in your area or country. It is important to stay up to date with local guidelines and recommendations provided by your local health authority. Since its introduction, COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives across the world by providing protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Even though vaccines protect against severe disease and death, it is still possible to spread SARS-CoV-2 to others after being vaccinated.",
