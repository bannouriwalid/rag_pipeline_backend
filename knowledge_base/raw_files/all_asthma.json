    "symptoms": "Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing at night or early in the morning. If you have asthma, you have it all the time, but you will have asthma attacks only when something bothers your lungs. An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing. The attack happens in your body's airways, which are the paths that carry air to your lungs. As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller, like the branches of a tree are smaller than the tree trunk. During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrink. Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways. You can control your asthma by knowing the warning signs of an asthma attack, staying away from things that cause an attack, and following your doctor's advice.",
    "diagnosis": "It can be hard to tell if someone has asthma, especially in children under age 5. A doctor can help you find out if you have asthma. During a checkup, a doctor may ask if you cough a lot, especially at night. He or she may also ask whether your breathing problems are worse after physical activity or at certain times of year. The doctor may ask about chest tightness, wheezing, and colds lasting more than 10 days. He or she may ask whether anyone in your family has or has had asthma, allergies, or other breathing problems. The doctor may ask about your home and whether you have missed school or work or have trouble doing certain things. The doctor may also do a breathing test, called spirometry, to find out how well your lungs are working. Spirometry tests how much air you breathe out after taking a very deep breath before and after you use asthma medicine.",
    "symptom management": "Take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you and stay away from things that can trigger an attack to control your asthma. Everyone with asthma does not take the same medicine. You can breathe in some medicines and take other medicines as a pill. Asthma medicines can be used in several ways -- as reliever therapy or as controller therapy. If you need to use your reliever medicine more and more, visit your doctor to see if you need a different medicine. Controller medicines help you have fewer and milder asthma attacks. Asthma medicines can have side effects. Most side effects are mild and soon go away. Ask your doctor about the side effects of your medicines.",

    "Common asthma triggers": "Secondhand smoke, smoke created by a smoker and breathed in by a second person, can trigger an asthma attack. If you have asthma, people should never smoke near you. Dust mites can trigger an asthma attack. Dust mites are microscopic bugs that are in many homes. To prevent attacks: Use allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase covers. Don't use down-filled pillows, quilts, or comforters. Wash your bedding weekly and dry it completely. Vacuum regularly using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter. Keep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%. Air pollution can trigger an asthma attack. This pollution can come from factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Pay attention to air quality forecasts on radio, television, and the internet. Cockroaches and other pests are often found where food is eaten and crumbs are left behind. To control pests in your home: Remove as many water and food sources as you can. Clean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away. Store food in airtight containers. Keep trash in a closed container. Vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice often. Seal cracks in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing. Avoid using sprays and foggers as these can cause asthma attacks. Furry pets can trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. If you think a furry pet may be causing attacks, you may want to find the pet another home. If you can't or don't want to find a new home for the pet, protect yourself by: Keeping pets out of bedrooms,, Washing furry pets,, Using an air cleaner with a HEPA filter, and, Using allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers. People with asthma are not allergic to their pet's fur, so trimming a pet's fur will not help your asthma. Breathing in mold can trigger an asthma attack whether or not you are allergic to mold. Indoors mold grows in damp areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, or where water damage has occurred. Get rid of mold in your home to control your attacks. To reduce mold exposure in your home: Dry damp or wet items within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth. Fix water leaks as soon as you can. Replace ceiling tiles and carpet if they are moldy. Use an air conditioner or a dehumidifier to keep indoor humidity low. Keep humidity under 50%. Check more than once a day with a hygrometer. Scrub mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water. Dry completely. Run the bathroom exhaust fan or open the window when showering. Other triggers for an asthma attack include: Infections linked to flu, colds, and RSV, Sinus infections, allergies, or pollen, Breathing in some chemicals or fragrances, Acid reflux, Bad weather, such as thunderstorms or high humidity and cold, dry air, Some foods and medicines for people allergic to them, Physical exercise or strong emotions that lead to very fast breathing",

    "First steps": "Follow your Asthma Action Plan, Take all your asthma medication exactly as prescribed. Don't stop any medications or change your asthma treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Make sure that you have at least 30 days of non-prescription medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for a long time. Know how to use your inhaler. Avoid your asthma triggers.",
    "Facing challenges": "Take everyday precautions. Wash your hands. Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to reduce the number of germs on them. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Wash your hands: Before, during, and after preparing food, Before eating food, After using the toilet, After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet, Before and after caring for someone who is sick, After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, After touching garbage, Clean and disinfect. Clean things you or your family touch frequently like tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, remotes, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Avoid disinfectants that can cause an asthma attack. Have someone who doesn't have asthma clean and disinfect. When using cleaning and disinfecting products: Make sure that people with asthma are not in the room. Avoid products that can cause an asthma attack. Open windows or doors and use a fan that blows air outdoors. Apply the cleaner to a cloth or paper towel--don't spray it into the air. Always follow the instructions on the product label. Take steps to help yourself cope. Strong emotions can trigger an asthma attack. Help yourself cope with stress and anxiety.",

    "What Is Asthma?": "Asthma is a chronic condition that affects 1 in 13 Americans. Asthma is a chronic (long-term) condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. This makes it harder for air to flow out of your airways when you breathe out. About 1 in 13 people in the United States have asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It affects people of all ages and often starts during childhood. Certain things, such as pollen, exercise, viral infections, or cold air, can set off or worsen asthma symptoms . These are called asthma triggers . When symptoms get worse, you can experience an asthma attack . There is no cure for asthma, but treatment and an asthma action plan can help you manage the condition. The plan may include monitoring, avoiding triggers, and using medicines. FACT SHEET Asthma Facts for Patients and Families Get basic facts about what asthma is and how it affects your airways.

    "Symptoms": "Symptoms of asthma may include: Wheezing, which is a whistling sound when you breathe out Coughing, especially at night or early morning Shortness of breath Chest tightness Asthma is a chronic condition that makes it harder to breathe. Learn how asthma affects the lungs and about common symptoms with this animated video. Asthma can be managed. If you have asthma, talk to a healthcare provider about making an asthma action plan. Other conditions can cause these symptoms. But in asthma, the symptoms often follow a pattern: They come and go over time or within the same day. They start or get worse with viral infections, such as a cold. They are triggered by exercise, allergies, cold air, or breathing too fast from laughing or crying. They are worse at night or in the morning. Asthma symptoms in young children may look different than symptoms in others. It is also possible for symptoms to change as you get older. Watch out for these signs that your asthma might be getting worse: You have symptoms more often than usual, or they feel worse. You need your reliever medicine more often than usual. You wake up at night because of coughing or other asthma symptoms. You have trouble with usual activities, including exercise, because of your asthma."

    "Asthma Attack": "Airway in the lungs narrowing from an asthma attack. A normal airway is wide, compared with the narrowed, inflamed airway typical of an asthma attack. Asthma attacks, or flare-ups, happen when swelling or tightening narrows the airways, making it harder to breathe. During an asthma attack, symptoms get much worse. Attacks can come on quickly or gradually and may be life-threatening. People with asthma that is difficult to treat may get asthma attacks more often.",
    "What does an asthma attack feel like?": "Asthma attacks can be very scary. For some people, an attack starts with coughing. Your chest may feel tight or like someone is sitting on it. Some people say it feels like having the air sucked out of you or trying to suck air in through a straw. You may start to wheeze or feel lightheaded.",
    "Have a plan for asthma attacks": "Follow your asthma action plan to help you know what to do and when to call 9-1-1 for emergency care. You should also use your reliever inhaler as soon as you start to have symptoms. Your asthma action plan should explain how to tell if your asthma is getting worse and when to increase your reliever and controller medicines. You may be able to manage an asthma flare-up with just your reliever inhaler. If you have a serious asthma attack or your symptoms do not go away soon after taking your reliever medicine, you may need medical attention.",
    "When to call your healthcare provider": "You should seek care right away if you or your child have symptoms and: Have been hospitalized for asthma in the past year or had life-threatening asthma attacks in the past Recently needed corticosteroids taken by mouth to treat asthma Have not been using inhaled corticosteroids Use more than one canister of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) medicine, a reliever medicine, each month Have a mental health condition or an alcohol or drug use disorder Do not closely follow your asthma action plan Have a food allergy For young children with asthma, call 9-1-1 if they: Seem drowsy, confused, or troubled Have a blue tint to the skin and lips Have a fast heartbeat Call your provider if: Your medicines do not relieve an asthma attack Your peak flow number is low, if you use a peak flow meter",
    "When to go to the ER": "You should go to the emergency room if your symptoms do not go away soon after taking your at-home medicines or if you have a serious asthma attack. If you need emergency care, you may receive medicines through a nebulizer (a small machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist that you can breathe in) or through an intravenous (IV) line in your arm. In severe circumstances, you may also need oxygen therapy or a ventilator to help you breathe."

    "What causes asthma?": "The exact causes for developing asthma are unknown and may be different from person to person. However, asthma can also occur when the body\u2019s natural defenses against germs and sickness react strongly to a new substance in the lungs. Asthma usually starts during childhood when the body\u2019s defense system is still taking shape. However some people don\u2019t show signs of asthma until adulthood \u2014 this is known as adult- onset asthma. Certain factors can affect how your lungs develop or how your body fights germs. Many factors may work together to cause you to develop asthma, such as: Things in the environment (called allergens ) that affected you as a baby or young child, including cigarette smoke or certain germs Viral infections that affect breathing Family history, such as a parent who has asthma (especially your mother) The following may also raise the risk of developing asthma. The following may also raise the risk of developing asthma: Allergies: Asthma is usually a type of allergic reaction. People who have asthma often have other types of allergies, such as food or pollen allergies. Obesity : Being overweight can raise your risk of developing asthma or make your asthma symptoms worse. Race or ethnicity: Puerto Rican people and Black or African American people have a higher risk of developing asthma than people of other racial or ethnic groups. Black or African American and Hispanic children are more likely than non-Hispanic White children to die from asthma. Sex: More boys than girls have asthma as children. In adults, asthma is more common among women. Occupational hazards: Breathing in chemicals or industrial dust in the workplace can raise your risk of developing asthma. Climate change: Air pollution and changing weather patterns contribute to asthma onset and exposure to allergens.

    "How asthma affects the lungs": "Normally, the body\u2019s natural defense system helps fight infections. But it may also respond to things you breathe in, such as pollen or mold. In some people, the defense system reacts strongly by creating inflammation . The airways may also become too sensitive, or hyperresponsive, and narrow too much when you breathe in something that is usually harmless. When this happens, the airways swell, narrow, and can create more mucus . The muscles around the airways may also tighten. This can make it even harder to breathe. Over time, the airway walls can become thicker. To understand asthma, it helps to learn how the lungs work .",
    "Can I prevent asthma?": "Because the exact cause is unknown, you may not be able to prevent asthma in yourself or your children. However, you can take steps to help prevent asthma from developing. They include doing your best to keep your home free of dampness and mold, avoiding air pollution as much as possible, and making a healthy lifestyle a priority for you and your family, for example, by adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Research for your health NHLBI-supported research on asthma has led to more and better treatment options to improve the health of people who have asthma. Through our current research, we hope to better understand how our genes and the environment we live in affect our risk for developing asthma. Learn more about our asthma research.",
    "Asthma triggers": "Asthma triggers are things that set off or make asthma symptoms worse. Common triggers include: Indoor allergens, such as dust mites, mold, and pet dander or fur Outdoor allergens, such as pollens and mold Emotional stress Physical activity, although with treatment you or your child should still be able to stay active Infections, such as colds, the flu, or COVID-19 Certain medicines, such as aspirin, which may cause serious breathing problems in people with asthma that is difficult to treat Poor air quality or very cold air Learn about avoiding triggers to help manage your asthma."

FACT SHEET Tips for Talking With Your Healthcare Provider Get tips for talking to your healthcare provider and sample questions to ask at your next appointment. View the fact sheet",
    "Diagnostic tests": "Your healthcare provider may want to run some tests to diagnose your asthma. Lung function tests Lung function tests measure how well you can breathe in and out: Spirometry measures how much air you breathe out and how fast. Some people feel lightheaded or tired from the breathing effort for this test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. The test can be done during spirometry or with a small handheld device. Bronchodilator responsiveness tests measure how much better you can blow air after inhaling a fast-acting bronchodilator, a medicine that helps open your airways by relaxing the muscles around them. The test compares your spirometry or PEF results before and after the medicine. Challenge tests Challenge tests, also called bronchial provocation tests, assess how sensitive your airways are. These tests compare how fast you can blow air before and after a challenge agent. Challenge agents are substances or activities that may tighten the muscles in your airways if they become irritated from being too sensitive, including: Inhaled medicines such as methacholine, mannitol, or histamine Allergens or irritants that cause no reaction in people who do not have asthma Exercise, which cools and dries the airways Hyperventilation, or breathing in short, quick breaths Other diagnostic tests Your healthcare provider may want to run other tests to help diagnose your asthma. Some of them can also assess your risk of asthma flare-ups and predict how well you will respond to medicine: Allergy tests can find which allergens, such as pet dander or pollen, cause a reaction in your body when you are around them. Your provider may run these tests if you have a history of allergies. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests measure how much nitric oxide is in your breath. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your airways are inflamed, which can make it hard to breathe. This test does not require heavy breathing and has few risks. Blood tests can measure levels of white blood cells, which can indicate inflammation. Blood tests can also help find your allergies. A chest CT scan may show whether the walls of your airways are thicker. Most diagnostic tests for asthma do not work well for young children. This can make it difficult to diagnose asthma in children ."

    "How is asthma treated?": "Some people take daily medicines to control and prevent symptoms . You can also carry medicines, such as a reliever inhaler, to use during an asthma attack . Your healthcare provider may adjust your treatment until your asthma symptoms are controlled. Learn more about NHLBI-supported asthma research on personalized treatments and other new approaches that improve the health and the quality of life for people who have asthma.",
    "Quick-relief medicines": "Quick-relief medicines, or relievers, help prevent or ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They may be the only medicines you need if your asthma is mild or happens only with physical activity. Your healthcare provider will probably prescribe a quick-relief inhaler for you to carry at all times. For the treatment to work well, make sure to learn how to use your asthma inhaler correctly . The following are common relievers. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) open the airways so air can flow through. Side effects can include tremors and rapid heartbeat. Oral corticosteroids reduce swelling in your airways. Short-acting anticholinergics help open the airways quickly. This medicine may be less effective than SABAs, but it is an option for people who may have side effects from SABAs.",
    "Long-term control medicines": "Your healthcare provider may prescribe controller medicines to take daily to help prevent asthma attacks and control symptoms: Corticosteroids (steroid hormone medicines) reduce inflammation in the body. They may be taken as a pill or inhaled. The pill form can have more serious side effects than the inhaled form. Over time, high doses can raise your risk of cataracts (clouding of the eye) or osteoporosis . Common side effects from inhaled corticosteroids include a hoarse voice or a mouth infection called thrush. Biologi medicines, such as benralizumab, may help with asthma that is difficult to control. These medicines are injected into a vein or below the skin. Leukotriene modifiers reduce swelling and keep your airways open. Your provider may prescribe these pills alone or with steroid medicine. Inhaled mast cell stabilizers, such as cromolyn, help prevent swelling in your airways when you are around allergens or other asthma triggers. Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, such as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), may be added to your inhaler to prevent your airways from narrowing.

    "Treating specific asthma types": "Some people only have asthma symptoms in certain situations or around specific triggers. Your healthcare provider may give you special instructions to help with your asthma in those cases. Exercise-induced asthma In exercise-induced asthma, your symptoms start or get worse when you do physical activity. Your provider may recommend taking a reliever medicine before exercising to prevent symptoms short term. If you are taking inhaled corticosteroids to control your asthma, you may have fewer symptoms when you exercise. Training regularly and warming up before you exercise can also help prevent symptoms. Talk to your provider if your asthma symptoms make it difficult to stay physically active. It may be a sign that your asthma is not well controlled or is getting worse. Occupational asthma Occupational asthma is asthma that develops or gets worse in the workplace. It can happen in an adult who is around allergens, for example, dust and mold, or other sensitizing agents at work. Once you become sensitized to a substance, being around a very small amount can be enough to trigger serious symptoms. Your asthma can continue to get worse every time you are around the trigger. To prevent asthma flare-ups, you should remove the sensitizing agent from your place of work and avoid any further contact. Allergic asthma Allergic asthma often starts at a young age. Breathing can become difficult when you are around certain allergens, such as pollens, dust mites, or mold. Avoiding the allergens that trigger your asthma can help control your symptoms and prevent flare-ups. Typical treatment includes inhaled corticosteroids. Your healthcare provider may also recommend adding biologic medicines or allergy shots, which can be specific to the allergen. Some people only have seasonal allergic asthma, which means that they do not have symptoms outside of a certain pollen season. Your provider may recommend medicines, such as a daily controller or a reliever inhaler, from the start of your allergy season until a few weeks after the season ends. Nocturnal asthma Nocturnal asthma refers to asthma symptoms that occur at night. It is not a separate type of asthma, but a sign of poor symptom control. It is common for asthma symptoms to get worse at night or in the early morning. Sometimes, your symptoms may wake you up at night. If this happens often, it may be a sign that your asthma is not well controlled. Being around allergens while you sleep may also worsen your symptoms at night. Knowing your asthma triggers and avoiding them at night can help you manage your asthma and sleep better. Participate in a study We lead or sponsor many trials and studies on asthma.

    "Know your asthma triggers": "Follow these steps to avoid triggers: Keep pets with fur out of your home or bedrooms if animal fur triggers asthma symptoms. Remove dust and mold from your house. Remove yourself from what is triggering your symptoms in the workplace. If you have occupational asthma, even low levels of allergens can trigger symptoms. Limit your time outdoors if allergen levels are high. Keep windows closed and avoid intense outdoor activity when air quality is low. For guidance, check the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Air Quality Forecast Guidance . Thunderstorms can also affect air quality. Take steps to avoid lung infections.

    "Make healthy lifestyle changes": "Your healthcare provider may recommend healthy lifestyle changes to help keep asthma symptoms in check: Aim for a healthy weight. Having overweight or obesity can make asthma harder to manage. Talk to your provider about programs that can help. Even a small weight loss can help symptoms. Choose heart-healthy foods. Eating more fruits and vegetables can provide important health benefits and is linked to a lower risk of developing asthma and better control of symptoms. Get regular physical activity. Even though exercise is an asthma trigger for some people, you should not avoid it. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your provider about what level of physical activity is right for you. Ask about medicines that can help you stay active. Manage stress. Breathing and relaxation techniques can help symptoms. Meet with a mental health professional if you have anxiety, depression, or panic attacks. Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking tobacco and breathing in secondhand smoke make asthma harder to treat. Heating tobacco, inhaling (vaping) electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), and being exposed to secondhand vapor may also worsen asthma symptoms. An ingredient in the tobacco plant that makes you addicted to smoking (nicotine) and flavorings in e-cigarettes may damage your lungs. Get enough good quality sleep. Getting quality sleep can sometimes be hard with asthma. Develop healthy sleep habits, such as going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, following a calming bedtime routine, and keeping your bedroom cool and dark.",
    "Pregnancy and asthma": "Your asthma symptoms may change while you are pregnant. You are also at higher risk of asthma attacks. Keep your asthma under control and contact your healthcare provider if anything changes. Your provider may continue to treat you with daily medicines, such as inhaled corticosteroids . If you want to adjust your medicines, talk to your provider first. Controlling your asthma can help prevent pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. Asthma and COVID-19 If you have asthma, you may have a higher risk of getting sick from COVID-19. Take steps to protect yourself and continue taking your medicine as usual. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions."

    "Overview": "Asthma is a chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the airways, which makes it harder to breathe. Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. These symptoms can be mild or severe and can come and go over time. Although asthma can be a serious condition, it can be managed with the right treatment. People with symptoms of asthma should speak to a health professional.",
    "Impact": "Asthma is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. People with under-treated asthma can suffer sleep disturbance, tiredness during the day, and poor concentration. Asthma sufferers and their families may miss school and work, with financial impact on the family and wider community. If symptoms are severe, people with asthma may need to receive emergency health care and they may be admitted to hospital for treatment and monitoring. In the most severe cases, asthma can lead to death.",
    "Symptoms": "Symptoms of asthma can vary from person to person. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse. This is known as an asthma attack. Symptoms are often worse at night or during exercise. Common symptoms of asthma include: a persistent cough, especially at night, wheezing when exhaling and sometimes when inhaling, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sometimes even when resting, chest tightness, making it difficult to breathe deeply., Some people will have worse symptoms when they have a cold or during changes in the weather. Other triggers can include dust, smoke, fumes, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers, strong soaps and perfume. Symptoms can be caused by other conditions as well. People with symptoms should talk to a healthcare provider.",
    "Causes": "Many factors have been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma, although it is often difficult to find a single, direct cause. Asthma is more likely if other family members also have asthma \u2013 particularlya close relative, such as a parent or sibling., Asthma is more likely in people who have other allergic conditions,such as eczema and rhinitis (hay fever)., Urbanization is associated with increased asthma prevalence,probably due to multiple lifestyle factors., Events in early life affect the developing lungs and can increasethe risk of asthma. These include low birth weight, prematurity, exposureto tobacco smoke and other sources of air pollution, as well as viralrespiratory infections., Exposure to a range of environmental allergens and irritants arealso thought to increase the risk of asthma, including indoor and outdoorair pollution, house dust mites, moulds, and occupational exposure tochemicals, fumes or dust., Children and adults who are overweight or obese are at a greaterrisk of asthma.,",
    "Treatment": "Asthma cannot be cured but there are several treatments available. The most common treatment is to use an inhaler, which delivers medication directly to the lungs. Inhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life. There are two main types of inhaler: bronchodilators (suchas salbutamol), that open the air passages and relieve symptoms; and, steroids (such as beclometasone)that reduce inflammation in the air passages, which improves asthmasymptoms and reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks and death., People with asthma may need to use their inhaler every day. Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available. Using an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers. Access to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third. It is also important to raise community awareness to reduce the myths and stigma associated with asthma in some settings.",
    "Self-care": "People with asthma and their families need education to understand more about their asthma. This includes their treatment options, triggers to avoid, and how to manage their symptoms at home. It is important for people with asthma to know how to increase their treatment when their symptoms are worsening to avoid a serious attack. Healthcare providers may give an asthma action plan to help people with asthma to take greater control of their treatment.",
