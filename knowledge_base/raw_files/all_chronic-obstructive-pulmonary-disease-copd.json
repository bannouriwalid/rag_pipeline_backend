    "What Is COPD?": "COPD Basics Learn who is at risk for COPD, what symptoms to watch for, and how the disease affects the lungs. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a condition caused by damage to the airways or other parts of the lung. This damage leads to inflammation and other problems that block airflow and make it hard to breathe. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus . It can also cause breathing problems, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms . Because COPD is a progressive disease, its symptoms often develop slowly but worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Serious COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities such as walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. The term COPD refers to two main conditions: Emphysema develops when there is damage to the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. In emphysema, it is harder for your lungs to move air out of your body. Chronic (long-term) bronchitis is caused by repeated or constant irritation and inflammation in the lining of the airways. A lot of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have a mixture of both emphysema and chronic bronchitis in different proportions, and how serious each condition is varies from person to person. In the United States, COPD affects more than 14 million adults, and many others do not know they have it. More than half of those diagnosed are women. Rates are higher than average in American Indian and Alaska Native communities and in rural areas. COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. INFOGRAPHIC COPD in Rural Communities Infographic Learn what makes COPD a disease of rural America and how to take action. View the infographic. The good news is that COPD can often be prevented, mainly by not smoking. In the United States and other high-income countries, cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. Worldwide, however, tobacco is related to just half of all COPD cases. In the developing world, air pollution plays a much larger role. A genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can also cause the disease. If you have smoked or have COPD symptoms, ask your healthcare provider about your risk of COPD. Even people in their 40s have higher rates of COPD than the population overall, so don\u2019t hesitate to ask. Although there is no cure, treatments and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease. You may also need oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, or medicines to treat complications. QUICK GUIDE A Quick Guide on COPD This guide provides an overview of COPD and its symptoms.

    "Symptoms": "At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more serious. There may be times when symptoms suddenly worsen \u2014 known as a flare-up or an exacerbation \u2014 because of triggers such as an infection or something in the environment like dust or smoke.",
    "COPD symptoms": "Recognize the Signs of COPD Earlier diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in quality of life for people who have COPD. Common symptoms of COPD include: Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. You may feel like breathing takes more effort or that you are gasping for air. An ongoing cough or a cough that produces a lot of mucus, sometimes called a smoker\u2019s cough. This is often the first symptom of COPD. Wheezing or a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe. Chest tightness or heaviness, which may make it hard to take a deep breath or make it painful to breathe. Fatigue or extreme tiredness. Not everyone who has these symptoms has COPD. Likewise, not everyone with COPD has all these symptoms. Your healthcare provider can determine whether you have COPD. You may also have additional conditions that need to be diagnosed and treated. It is very common for people with COPD to have other conditions, including heart disease. If your symptoms are mild, you may adjust your lifestyle to make breathing easier. For example, you may take the elevator instead of the stairs. For more serious symptoms, such as becoming short of breath during physical work, your healthcare provider can provide treatments and other ways to help. Severe COPD can cause additional symptoms, such as lack of appetite, loss of weight and muscle, anxiety, and depression. Learn more about living with COPD .

    "COPD flare-ups": "Certain triggers, such as smells, cold air, poor air quality, colds, the flu, or a lung infection, can lead to a sudden worsening of symptoms. When this happens, it is called a flare-up or an exacerbation . With a flare-up, you have a harder time breathing. You may also have chest tightness or a fever. You may need to cough or clear your throat more. Or you might find yourself coughing up yellow or green phlegm. Call your healthcare provider right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. Your provider may prescribe antibiotics to treat an infection. They may also give you other medicines, such as bronchodilators and inhaled or oral steroids, to help you breathe. Serious symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. How serious a flare-up is depends on the amount of lung damage you have. Poor sleep can also increase the risk of a flare-up. Take steps to keep yourself healthy to help prevent a flare-up.",
    "When to call your healthcare provider": "As soon as you notice symptoms of COPD in yourself or a loved one, make an appointment to see a provider. Don\u2019t wait for your symptoms to become serious. A flare-up may require treatment in a hospital. You \u2014 or, if you are unable, your family members or friends \u2014 should call 9-1-1 if you are experiencing unusual events: You are having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails have turned blue or gray, a sign of a low oxygen level in your blood. People around you notice that you are not mentally alert. Your heartbeat is very fast. The recommended treatment for your symptoms is not working."

    "Causes and Risk Factors": "Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD in the United States. Long-term smoking or breathing in tobacco smoke or pollutants in the air damages the lungs and airways. Causes and Risk Factors of COPD Learn about NHLBI research to help understand why some people get COPD or get more severe COPD than others.",
    "How COPD affects the lungs": "In healthy lungs, the air that is breathed in travels down bronchial tubes, which often branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli, which are elastic or stretchy. Learn more about how air flows through the airways in our How the Lungs Work topic. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways for one or more reasons: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal lungs and lungs in a person who has COPD. Figure A shows the location of the lungs and airways in the body. Figure B shows lungs damaged by COPD.",
    "What raises your risk of COPD?": "The following may raise your risk of COPD: Smoking: This is the main risk factor for COPD. Three out of four people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. People who have a family history of COPD are more likely to develop the disease if they smoke. Other lung irritants: These may include long-term exposure to air pollution, chemical fumes and dust from the environment or workplace, smoke from home cooking and heating fuels without ventilation, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. Research for your health NHLBI-supported research found that having smaller airways for your lung size can also raise your risk for COPD. Smaller airways can prevent your lungs from working as well as they should. Lung function declines naturally as we age, so people with smaller airways may develop symptoms like those of COPD later in life, even if they do not smoke or are not exposed to lung irritants. Learn more about our ongoing research on COPD. Changes to lung growth and development: Conditions affecting the lungs when a baby is still in the uterus or during childhood can increase the risk. Examples include smoking in pregnancy or childhood asthma. Air pollution can also limit the growth of a child\u2019s lungs and increase their risk of developing COPD. Infections: Conditions such as HIV and tuberculosis can raise your risk. Age: Your age may play a role in COPD risk if you have other risk factors, such as smoking. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin. A condition that runs in families, called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency : If you are born with this condition, smoking or long-term exposure to fumes or dust can lead to lung damage and COPD. AAT deficiency can also raise your risk for developing COPD at a younger age. Other potential genetic risk factors include vitamin D deficiency, and mutations in CHRNA genes .

    "How does COPD affect women and men differently?": "COPD affects both men and women. However, COPD may affect men and women differently. The reason for the differences in COPD between men and women is not known. Researchers think the cause may be related to hormones or other physiological differences, or differences in biology. Women also have smaller lungs than men do, which may make their airways more prone to narrowing when exposed to irritants."

    "How will your healthcare provider find out whether you have COPD?": "Your provider will diagnose COPD based on your symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. How Does A COPD Diagnosis Affect Your Loved Ones? Learn what a COPD diagnosis means for your family, why it\u2019s important for caregivers to take care of themselves, and how other family members can be supportive. Discuss your smoking habits or whether you have had contact with secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust. If you have persistent shortness of breath that gets worse over time, let your provider know, because this is the main symptom of COPD. If you have an ongoing cough, tell them how long you\u2019ve had it, how much you cough, and how much mucus comes up when you cough. Be sure to bring up any family history of COPD . Your provider will examine you and use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing or other abnormal chest sounds. Lung function and imaging tests will tell whether you have COPD and how serious it is. If your provider recommends getting an X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan to detect lung cancer or diagnose a breathing problem, ask them about your risk of COPD. If you get a COPD diagnosis, ask about genetic screening. Some people have a genetic condition that increases their risk of COPD, called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency . Screening is especially important if you have family members with AAT deficiency or who were diagnosed with COPD in their 40s or 50s or have liver disease. Likewise, if you are the first in your family to learn that AAT deficiency is part of your genetic makeup, ask your provider for advice on talking with family members about your results.",
    "Spirometry": "Diagnosing COPD Learn about spirometry and other diagnostic tests your provider may use to diagnose COPD based on your symptoms and risk factors. The main test for COPD is spirometry. It can detect COPD before symptoms are recognized. Your provider may also use the test results to find out how serious your COPD is and help set your treatment goals. Spirometry is a lung function test that measures how much air you breathe out and how fast you can blow air out. During the test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath in. Then you will blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine called a spirometer. Your healthcare team may have you inhale (breathe in) medicine that helps open your airways and then blow into the tube again. They can then compare your test results before and after taking the medicine. Learn more about spirometry tests .",
    "Other lung function tests": "Peak expiratory flow test This test measures how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. This test can be done during spirometry or with a small handheld device. Arterial blood gas test An arterial blood gas test measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. Arterial blood gas tests are usually done in a hospital but may be done in a healthcare provider\u2019s office. For this test, blood will be taken from an artery, usually in the wrist where your pulse is measured. Learn more about lung function tests .",
    "Lung imaging tests": "Chest X-ray A chest X-ray is a fast and painless imaging test that looks at the structures in and around your chest. The test cannot diagnose COPD, but it can be used to find other conditions that may interact with COPD. The test may be done in a healthcare provider\u2019s office, clinic, or hospital. You will stand, sit, or lie still for the test. Chest X-rays have few risks. The amount of radiation used in a chest X-ray is very small. Talk to your provider if you are or could be pregnant. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan A CT scan is a painless imaging test that takes many detailed pictures of your lungs and the inside of your chest. Computers can combine these pictures to create three-dimensional models that show the size, shape, and position of your lungs and structures in your chest. A chest CT scan can help find the cause of lung symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain. It can also tell your healthcare provider whether you have certain lung problems, such as a tumor, excess fluid around the lungs known as pleural effusion, or pneumonia. Your chest CT scan may be done in a medical imaging facility or hospital. You will lie still on a table that will slide into the scanner. You will hear soft buzzing or clicking sounds when you are inside the scanner and the scanner is taking pictures. You will be able to hear from and talk to the technician performing the test while you are inside the scanner. For some diagnoses, a contrast dye, often iodine-based, may be injected into a vein in your arm before the imaging test. In rare instances, some people have an allergic reaction to contrast dye. There is also a slight risk of cancer, particularly in growing children, because the test uses radiation. Although the amount of radiation from one test is usually less than the amount of radiation you are naturally exposed to over three years, patients should not receive more CT scans than what is recommended by clinical guidelines.

    "Prevention": "There is no routine screening for COPD. However, many people do not know they have COPD until they have serious symptoms . If you have risk factors for COPD, talk to your healthcare provider.",
    "Prevent COPD before it starts": "The best way to prevent COPD is to quit smoking or, if you don\u2019t smoke, not to start. Also try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dust, and secondhand smoke. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. If you smoke, talk with your provider about programs and products that can help you quit.",
    "Quit smoking": "Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to help slow the progression of COPD. It can help you live longer, too. Talk with your provider about how best to quit. Some people use e-cigarettes or vape to try to quit smoking tobacco, but this is not a good idea for smokers who have COPD. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, visit the Smoking and Your Heart page and Your Guide to a Healthy Heart . Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking.

    "Treatment": "If you are diagnosed with COPD, your healthcare provider will determine your treatment plan based on your symptoms and whether you have mild or severe COPD.",
    "Medicines": "Medicines to treat COPD symptoms include bronchodilators and steroids or nonsteroid medicines that reduce inflammation . A new add-on medicine approved in 2024 may help to control your disease. Your healthcare provider may prescribe an inhaler for you to always carry. Inhalers allow the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Many people have problems putting medicine in their inhaler, using the right inhalation technique, or cleaning the inhaler properly. Not all inhalers are used the same way. Make sure you are using your inhaler the right way, so you get the right amount of medicine. Ask your provider to show you the correct way to use your inhaler. If your COPD is mild and you don\u2019t have symptoms often, your provider may prescribe a short-acting bronchodilator that you take only when you have symptoms. Bronchodilators relax the muscles around your airways, opening them up to help make breathing easier. Short-acting bronchodilators last about 4 to 6 hours. If your COPD is moderate or severe, you may need long-acting bronchodilators that last about 12 hours or more or an anti-inflammatory. You take these every day. A new medication approved in 2024 combines a bronchodilator with a medicine that reduces inflammation (nonsteroid). The medication also helps the body clear mucus. If your COPD is severe or your symptoms flare up often, your provider may prescribe a combination of bronchodilators along with an inhaled steroid. Steroids help reduce the inflammation or swelling in your airways that makes it hard to breathe. If a combination of inhaled medicines does not help, an add-on medication, which is used in people with asthma and was approved in 2024 for COPD, may improve your breathing. Antibiotics may be used to treat flare-ups caused by an infection. Be sure to discuss a plan with your provider for treating a flare-up, including any special medicine you might need.",
    "Pulmonary rehabilitation": "Pulmonary rehabilitation is a supervised program that includes exercise training, health education, and breathing techniques for people who have certain lung conditions or have had a lung transplant. Your provider may talk to you about pulmonary rehabilitation to help you breathe easier and improve your quality of life. Some people find it helpful to do a rehabilitation program using the phone, the web, or a mobile app, This way, they can get treatment even if it\u2019s hard to get to a rehabilitation center. Learn more about pulmonary rehabilitation .",
    "Oxygen therapy": "Oxygen therapy is a treatment that delivers oxygen for you to breathe. If you qualify for oxygen therapy, you will receive it from tubes resting in your nose or from a face mask. You may need oxygen therapy if you have a condition that causes your blood oxygen levels to be too low. Oxygen therapy can be given for a short or long period of time in the hospital, in another medical setting, or at home. Oxygen poses a fire risk, so you should never smoke or use flammable materials when using oxygen. You may experience side effects from this treatment, such as a dry or bloody nose, tiredness, and morning headaches. Oxygen therapy is generally safe.",
    "Surgery": "Surgery may benefit some people who have COPD. It usually is an option only when serious symptoms have not improved with medicines. Bullectomy removes one or more very large bullae from the lungs. Bullae are larger air spaces that form when the walls of the air sacs are destroyed. These air spaces can become so large that they interfere with breathing. Stents, or small mesh tubes, can help release air trapped in the lungs or keep airways open. One-way endobronchial valves can be implanted in one of your bronchial tubes . These valves allow air to exit the damaged or diseased parts of the lung, but not reenter. Lung volume reduction surgery removes damaged tissue from the lungs and helps the lungs work better.",
    "Lung transplant": "A lung transplant is surgery to remove a diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung. Lung transplants are used to improve quality of life and extend the lifespan for people who have severe or advanced chronic lung conditions that do not respond to other treatments. During a lung transplant, you will be given general anesthesia and will not be awake for the surgery. A surgeon will open your chest, cut the main airway and blood vessels, and remove your diseased lung. The surgeon will connect the healthy donor lung, reconnect the blood vessels, and close your chest. After the surgery, you will recover in the hospital for 1 to 3 weeks. After leaving the hospital, you will visit your healthcare provider often to make sure that you are recovering well. To help prevent your body from rejecting the new lung, you will need to take medicines that suppress your immune system for the rest of your life. Practicing good hygiene, getting annual vaccines, and adopting healthy lifestyle choices such as heart-healthy eating and not smoking are also very important."

Your provider may change or adjust your treatments to relieve and treat symptoms .",
    "How to manage COPD at home": "Managing COPD Learn healthy living tips to help manage COPD symptoms. Join a COPD self-management program. Ask your healthcare provider for a program that will help you learn about COPD and interventions that can make it easier to manage the disease and have a better quality of life. This might help you deal with fatigue, for example. Talk to your provider about following an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. If you have trouble eating enough because of symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue, you may not get all the calories and nutrients you need. This can make your symptoms worse and raise your risk for infections. Your doctor may suggest eating smaller meals more often throughout the day, resting before eating, and taking vitamins or nutritional supplements. Eating a healthy diet with fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fish may also help protect your lungs. Ask your provider what types of activities you can safely do. You may find it hard to remain active with your symptoms. However, physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Put items you use often in one easy-to-reach place. Find simple ways to cook, clean, and do other chores. For example, you might want to use a small table or cart with wheels to move things around and a pole or tongs with long handles to reach things. Ask for help in making things more accessible in your house so that you will not need to climb stairs as often. Keep your clothes loose-fitting and wear clothes and shoes that are easy to put on and take off. Use your medicines as recommended. Make sure you are using the inhaler correctly. It is normal for patients to have problems with their inhaler, so do not worry about asking your healthcare team multiple times how to use it. There are many different inhaler types, and the best type for you might change over time. Take your inhaler when you visit your healthcare provider so they can give you advice or see if you need a change. Stay indoors when air quality is poor and consider using an air filter. Air pollution can make it harder to breathe and worsen other symptoms of COPD. It can also lead to more flare-ups and make them worse. These threats to the health of people with COPD may grow as climate change increases the frequency of wildfires and periods of extreme heat. See a dentist regularly and brush your teeth often to maintain good oral health. If you experience heartburn, ask your provider to recommend ways to reduce it. Reflux can increase your risk of a flare-up. TOOLKIT The COPD Caregiver\u2019s Toolkit Are you caring for someone with COPD? The NHLBI offers information and tools to help. View the toolkit.",
    "Avoid triggers that can cause flare-ups": "Over time, you may notice a sudden worsening of symptoms, called a flare-up, that may happen if you encounter certain scents or breathe in dust or fumes. Learning what these triggers are can help you avoid them and prevent flare-ups. Stay away from lung irritants, including chemical fumes, dust, smoke from home cooking and heating fuels, and secondhand smoke (fumes in the air from other people smoking). Check the air quality where you live, and keep your windows closed and stay at home when there is a lot of air pollution or dust outside. Consider using an air filter, especially if wildfires are common where you live. Avoid being in places where there are cold temperatures. Stay up to date with vaccines . This includes getting regular COVID-19, flu, and pneumonia shots, when available, to help prevent infections. Infections can trigger flare-ups. The respiratory syncytial virus vaccine is recommended if you are 60 years old or older and have COPD or if you are pregnant. Other vaccines recommended for certain groups are the TDAP vaccine, to protect against whooping cough, and shingles shots. Seek emergency care if you have a severe flare-up. Keep phone numbers handy for your healthcare provider, your hospital, and someone who can take you for medical care. You also should have on hand directions to the provider\u2019s office and hospital and a list of all the medicines you are taking.",
    "Does COPD raise my risk for other conditions?": "COPD may raise your risk of developing other health conditions because of damage to your airways or common risk factors. Frequent colds or other respiratory infections, such as the flu, or influenza, often happen if you have COPD. Heart disease risks are higher for people who have COPD than for people who do not have COPD. Other health problems, such as obesity or peripheral artery disease, that are caused by similar risk factors (smoking or not getting enough physical activity), may also be present. These other health problems may, in turn, make COPD worse. If you smoked before getting COPD, you may be at risk of developing lung cancer. Your provider may suggest yearly computed tomography scans to check. Talk to your healthcare provider about your risk for other health problems and any healthy lifestyle changes you can make.

    "Overview": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease causing restricted airflow and breathing problems. It is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people with COPD, the lungs can get damaged or clogged with phlegm. Symptoms include cough, sometimes with phlegm, difficulty breathing, wheezing and tiredness. Smoking and air pollution are the most common causes of COPD. People with COPD are at higher risk of other health problems. COPD is not curable but symptoms can improve if one avoids smoking and exposure to air pollution and gets vaccines to prevent infections. It can also be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation.",
    "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms of COPD are difficulty breathing, chronic cough (sometimes with phlegm) and feeling tired. COPD symptoms can get worse quickly. These are called flare-ups. These usually last for a few days and often require additional medicine. People with COPD also have a higher risk for other health problems. These include: lung infections, like the flu or pneumonia, lung cancer, heart problems, weak muscles and brittle bones, depression and anxiety, Common symptoms of COPD develop from mid-life onwards. As COPD progresses, people find it more difficult to carry out their normal daily activities, often due to breathlessness. There may be a considerable financial burden due to limitation of workplace and home productivity, and costs of medical treatment. COPD is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema usually refers to destruction of the tiny air sacs at the end of the airways in the lungs. Chronic bronchitis refers to a chronic cough with the production of phlegm resulting from inflammation in the airways. COPD and asthma share common symptoms (cough, wheeze and difficulty breathing) and people may have both conditions.",
    "Causes": "Several processes can cause the airways to become narrow and lead to COPD. There may be destruction of parts of the lung, mucus blocking the airways, and inflammation and swelling of the airway lining. COPD develops gradually over time, often resulting from a combination of risk factors: tobacco exposure from active smoking or passive exposure to second-hand smoke;, occupational exposure to dusts, fumes or chemicals;, indoor air pollution: biomass fuel (wood, animal dung, crop residue) or coal is frequently used for cooking and heating in low- and middle-income countries with high levels of smoke exposure;, early life events such as poor growth in utero, prematurity, and frequent or severe respiratory infections in childhood that prevent maximum lung growth;, asthma in childhood; and, a rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which can cause COPD at a young age, COPD should be suspected if a person has typical symptoms, and the diagnosis confirmed by a breathing test called spirometry, which measures how the lungs are working. In low- and middle-income countries, spirometry is often not available and so the diagnosis may be missed.",
    "Treatment": "COPD isn\u2019t curable, but it can get better by not smoking, avoiding air pollution and getting vaccines. It can be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation. There are several treatments available for COPD. Inhaled medicines that open and reduce swelling in the airways are the main treatments. Bronchodilator inhalers are the most important medicines for treating COPD. They relax the airways to keep them open. Short-acting bronchodilators start to work in seconds and can last for 4\u20136 hours. These are often used during flare-ups. Long-acting bronchodilators take longer to start working but last longer. These are taken daily and can be combined with inhaled steroids. Other treatments may also be used: Steroid pills and antibiotics are often used to treat flare-ups, Oxygen is used for people who have had COPD for a long time or have severe COPD, Pulmonary rehabilitation teaches exercises to improve your breathing and ability to exercise, Surgery may improve symptoms for some people with severe COPD, Some inhalers open the airways and may be given regularly to prevent or reduce symptoms, and to relieve symptoms during acute flare-ups. Inhaled corticosteroids are sometimes given in combination with these to reduce inflammation in the lungs. Inhalers must be taken using the correct technique, and in some cases with a spacer device to help deliver the medication into the airways more effectively. Access to inhalers is limited in many low- and middle-income countries; in 2021 salbutamol inhalers were generally available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries. Flare-ups are often caused by a respiratory infection, and people may be given an antibiotic or steroid tablets in addition to inhaled or nebulised treatment as needed.",
    "Living with copd": "Lifestyle changes can help improve symptoms of COPD. Quit smoking or vaping. This is the most important thing to do. Even if you have been smoking for many years, quitting can still help. Avoid second-hand smoke or smoke from indoor cooking fires. Stay physically active. Protect yourself from lung infections: Get a flu vaccine every year, Get the pneumonia vaccine, Get all available COVID-19 vaccines and make sure you have had the latest boosters, People living with COPD must be given information about their condition, treatment and self-care to help them to stay as active and healthy as possible.",
